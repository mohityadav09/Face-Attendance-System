# Face-Attendance-System-python project
## Project overview
### Description
The Face Attendance System is an automated solution for tracking and managing attendance using facial recognition technology. Instead of traditional methods like manual attendance registers or ID cards, this system offers a more convenient and efficient way to record attendance.

### Key Features
1. Facial Recognition: Utilizes face recognition algorithms to identify individuals.
2. Real-time Attendance: Captures attendance in real-time as individuals enter the designated area.
3. Database Integration: Integrates with databases to store and manage information about students or employees.
4. Automatic Recording: Automatically records attendance when recognized faces are detected.
5 .Reporting: Generates CSV file for datewise attendance record & keep track of total attendance of each student in realtime database.

### Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for development. 
OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks, including face detection and recognition.
Face Recognition Library: Provides pre-trained models and algorithms for face recognition.
Firebase: Database and storage solution for storing user information and attendance data.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
CVZone: Library for computer vision utilities and enhancements.

### Usage
Setup: Install required dependencies and configure the system.
Database: Populate the database with user information and images.
Recognition: Start the system to recognize faces and record attendance.
Reporting: Generate attendance reports as needed.
